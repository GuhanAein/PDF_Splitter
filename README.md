# PDF_Splitter
This Python script uses the PyPDF2 library to split a given PDF file into multiple smaller PDFs. You can specify the number of splits you want and provide the starting and ending page numbers for each split. The script then creates separate PDF files for each split, allowing you to efficiently extract specific sections of a larger PDF document.
